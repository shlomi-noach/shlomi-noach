### Software engineer and database geek

I am enthusiast about writing software and solving problems. I’ve worked with big, busy and highly available systems and services. I in particular enjoy sharing my solutions with the world via blogging (http://code.openark.org/blog/) and via open source.

I author or authored a bunch of open source projects:

- [orchestrator](https://github.com/openark/orchestrator)
- [gh-ost](https://github.com/github/gh-ost)
- [freno](https://github.com/github/freno)
- [common_schema](https://github.com/shlomi-noach/common_schema)
- [ccql](https://github.com/github/ccql)
- [zookeepercli](https://github.com/outbrain/zookeepercli)
and some more.

I curate a list of MySQL quality open source software: [awesome-mysql](https://github.com/shlomi-noach/awesome-mysql)

Recipient of MySQL Community Member of the Year, Oracle ACE, and Oracle Technologist of the Year award, I'm involved in the MySQL ecosystem community. I frequently present on conferences, see https://code.openark.org/blog/presentations for a collection of some of my recorded presentations + slide decks.

My take on CAP Theorem: [not what we thought it was, not what we are looking for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWvzyIiR8iA).

The peak of my carreer is the infamous [SQL Pie Chart query](http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/sql-pie-chart).
