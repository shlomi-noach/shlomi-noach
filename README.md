### Software engineer and database geek

I am enthusiast about writing software and solving problems. I’ve worked with big, busy and highly available systems and services. I in particular enjoy sharing my solutions with the world via blogging () and via open source.

I author or authored a bunch of open source projects:

- [https://github.com/openark/orchestrator](orchestrator)
- [https://github.com/github/gh-ost](gh-ost)
- [https://github.com/github/freno](freno)
- [https://github.com/shlomi-noach/common_schema](common_schema)
- [https://github.com/github/ccql](ccql)
- [https://github.com/outbrain/zookeepercli](zookeepercli)
and some more.

I curate a list of MySQL quality open source software: [https://github.com/shlomi-noach/awesome-mysql](awesome-mysql)

Recipient of MySQL Community Member of the Year, Oracle ACE, and Oracle Technologist of the Year award, I'm involved in the MySQL ecosystem community. I frequently present on conferences, see https://code.openark.org/blog/presentations for a collection of some of my recorded presentations + slide decks.

My take on CAP Theorem: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWvzyIiR8iA](not what we thought it was, not what we are looking for).

The peak of my carreer is the infamous [http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/sql-pie-chart](SQL Pie Chart query).
